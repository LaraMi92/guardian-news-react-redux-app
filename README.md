# guardian-news-react-redux-app

This app will allow you to retrieve articles from The Guardian's API using dates as queries.
Clicking on a year will render random articles from that year - choice only runs from 2010 to 2019, since no one wants to read news from 2020.

To run, install dependencies with **yarn** and then **yarn start** to launch the app.
