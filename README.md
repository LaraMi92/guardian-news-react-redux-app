# guardian-news-react-redux-app

This app will allow you to retrieve articles from The Guardian's API using dates as queries.
Clicking on a year will render 'fun' articles from that year - choice only runs from 2010 to 2019, since no one wants to read news from 2020.

To use the Guardian's API you need to generate your own key, which can be done here => https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/

To run, install dependencies with ```yarn``` and then ```yarn start``` to launch the app.
